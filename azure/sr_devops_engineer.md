# 🧠 Senior DevOps Engineer - Architecture Design Assignment

## 📌 Objective

Design a **production-ready architecture** for a high-traffic **.NET Core Web Application** hosted on **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**. Your submission should demonstrate your expertise in infrastructure design, DevOps practices, Azure-native services, security, and high availability.

---

## 🚀 Assignment Details

### 🎯 Scenario

You have been asked to design and document the **cloud infrastructure and DevOps strategy** for deploying a .NET Core web application on Azure, using Kubernetes and other Azure-native services.

---

## 📐 Architecture Components

Please address and document your approach for the following components:

### 🔹 Networking (Load Balancing, DNS, Ingress, WAF)

- Define how users will securely access the application.
- Include services like Azure Application Gateway, Azure Front Door, Azure Private DNS, and Web Application Firewall (WAF).
- Show how internal and external traffic is managed.

---

### 🔹 CI/CD (Tools, Pipeline Flow)

- Describe tools used (e.g., Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions).
- Provide a high-level flow for:
  - Building a .NET application
  - Running automated tests
  - Building and pushing Docker images
  - Deploying to AKS via YAML or Helm
- Discuss the use of environments and approvals for safe deployments.

---

### 🔹 Container Registry and Image Security

- Explain your use of Azure Container Registry (ACR).
- Describe how image scanning and vulnerability assessments are performed.
- Include access controls and identity integration with AAD.

---

### 🔹 High Availability and Autoscaling

- Define how your AKS cluster is configured for:
  - Availability zones
  - Node pool configuration
  - Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
  - Cluster Autoscaler

---

### 🔹 Secrets Management and Secure Configuration

- Describe your approach for storing secrets (e.g., Azure Key Vault, Kubernetes secrets with CSI driver).
- Discuss RBAC, Managed Identity, and audit strategies.

---

## 🔄 Traffic Flow and Connectivity

### 🛣️ User to App Traffic Flow

- Document the end-to-end flow from users to the app hosted in AKS.
- Include DNS resolution, ingress controller, and service-to-pod communication.

### 🖥️ Bastion Host Access

- Explain how a **Bastion host** is used to manage private access to AKS and other Azure resources.
- Ensure **all resources are privately accessible** from the Bastion only, using Private Endpoints, NSGs, and route tables.

---

## 🔁 Deployment Strategy

### 🔄 Blue-Green / Canary Deployments on AKS

- Describe your preferred deployment strategy and how you’d implement it.
- Mention the tools used (e.g., Kubernetes labels/selectors, ingress rules, Argo Rollouts, Helm hooks).
- Include rollback strategy and monitoring for safe rollout.

---

## 📂 Submission Guidelines

1. Write your responses clearly in this `README.md` file.
2. Add architectural diagrams using either of the following tools and include exported files:
   - [https://excalidraw.com/](https://excalidraw.com/)
   - [https://www.drawio.com/](https://www.drawio.com/)
3. Add any YAML, pipeline, or Terraform examples in relevant subfolders.
4. Push your solution to a GitHub repo or ZIP and send the link.

---

## ✅ Bonus

- Use diagrams to visually explain traffic flow and resource layout.
- Attach `.drawio` or `.excalidraw` design files in the repo under `/diagrams`.
