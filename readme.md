### üåü Bonus Points (Optional)
This section is entirely optional‚Äîskipping it won‚Äôt impact your evaluation. But if you're looking to go above and beyond, feel free to showcase your deeper knowledge with any of the following:

- Implement a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Bitbucket Pipelines) that:

- Builds your Docker image

- Pushes it to a container registry

- Applies your Terraform infrastructure automatically

Add anything else that reflects your understanding of DevOps best practices, automation, and cloud-native workflows.
